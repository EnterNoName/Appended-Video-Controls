Chrome extension that brings all the video controls in one place!

### The problem:
Have you ever found yourself on a website watching a video that doesn't have a speed slider?  
What about the case where there's no picture in picture mode button?

Well, worry no more! This chrome extension allows you to use the same decked out video contols as well as *keybinds (soon-ish)* everywhere.
